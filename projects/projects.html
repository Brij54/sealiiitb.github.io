		<h2>Symbolic Testing of Embedded Software Systems</h2>

		<p>
		Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a promising new paradigm in system
		development. Its potential stems from its emphasis on using high-level 
		modelling languages for specifying, designing and developing systems, while 
		automating many of the downstreams activities like programming, simulation
		and testing. A large family of commercial softwares are available which 
		support this paradigm. This has led to a wide-spread adoption of model-based
		approach in the Industry, particularly in the safety-critical embedded 
		domain. For example, Matlab Simulink is now a <i>de facto</i> standard development
		platform in the automotive and aerospace domain.
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>Symbolic testing</i> has proved to be a very 
		successful testing methology in program testing. There are a number of 
		characteristics in such models which add new challenges to applying 
		symbolic testing and as also provide opportunities to simplify the
		process.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this project, we apply symbolic testing to test models designed
		with Matlab Simulink and similar languages.

		<h2>Verification of Refinements of Embedded Software Architecture</h2>
		<p>
		Embedded software architectures typically describe the physical components
		of the embedded system along with the software components and are extensively
		being used to describe the architecture of software residing in automotive,
		avionics and other embedded applications. Such architectures are defined
		in a modular fashion like all others, with detailed architectural constructs
		evolving with successive refinements. We are exploring the problem of formally
		modeling and verifying embedded software architectures with the aim of 
		proving a refined architecture to be correct with respect to its abstract
		architecture, in terms of satisfying a set of specified properties. This
		project is currently using AADL as a benchmark language for embedded 
		software architecture. EventB is used to formally represent such architectures
		and refinements are being shown to be correct with respect to their 
		semantics as represented by EventB. 
		</p>

		<h2>Specification, Verification and Validation of Web-Applications</h2>
		<p>
		Representational State Transfer (REST) is the latest architectural style 
		catching a lot of attention in the domain of web-service design and 
		implementation. Web-services, due to their distributed, loosely-coupled,
		and syndicated architecture, provide very unique challenges to software
		engineers at every stage of SDLC, beginning with specification all the
		way upto testing.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this project, we are dealing with the challenges of formal specification
		and automated testing of web-services, specifically RESTful web-services
		-- the web-services following the REST architecture.</p>
