		<h2>Verification and validation of IoT systems </h2>
		<p>
		IoT (Internet of Things) connects different computing devices,
		sensors, actuators, people and virtually, any object. IoT systems are
		prevalent in several safety critical industries like health care,
		automotive, manufacturing systems, power grid etc. Our work in
		verification and validation of IoT systems has been along two
		directions.
		</p>

		<p>
		Towards formally verifying IoT systems, we have developed formal
		models in the theorem prover Event-B for several IoT protocols, MQTT,
		MQTT-SN, CoAP and XMPP. These application layer protocols provide
		properties that constitute the back-bone of correctness in many IoT
		systems. Using our formal models of these protocols developed in
		Event-B, we provide proofs of these protocols will satisfying
		properties like QoS (Quality of Service), message ordering, persistent
		sessions, request-response matching and timeout, confirmable message
		ID matching and timeout, exponential backoff etc. Our Event-B models
		have been specified first by building a common abstract model that
		encompasses common features and then using refinement, model
		decomposition and atomicity decomposition to specify detailed
		features. Such a modelling exercise, we believe, can be used to model
		full-fledged IoT systems that can be formally verified.
		</p>

		<p>
		On the validation side, we have developed a discrete Markov decision
		process based framework that can be used to make IoT systems power
		aware and self-optimize their power. Prototypes of such a framework
		are available in the Cooja simulator and can be used in realistic IoT
		systems. We are currently working on applying this idea to
		applications that use WiFi Direct.
