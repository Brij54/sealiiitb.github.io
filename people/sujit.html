	<h3>A Message to Prospective Students</h3>
		<p>First of all, let me thank the students who write to me seeking joint work whether as PhD, MS, or internship. Being written to this way is frankly flattering. Having said that, let me also share that the number of such messages is somewhat beyond what I can process even in a cursory manner. My instinct is to give a polite and personalised reply to each carefully worded letter that comes to my inbox, even if, it has to be a refusal. Unfortunately, even that is not scalable. It has come to our notice that many of these mails aren't so personal as they are designed to sound. Most are infact spams. The same text almost definitely gets copied to dozens of academicians across the country.</p>
		<p>Therefore, here's a little request. Please be specific in your message as to why you have written to me. Have you read my profile? Or have come across my work? Or have been referred to me by someone? Or share a common technical interest? If yes, then which? In short, leave significant clues in the text of your message to tell that the message is a hand-crafted one, and not mass-mailed to 50-100 people.</p>
		<p>If I am convinced that I am hearing from a human being and not a robot, I will be very happy to reply to your message.</p>
